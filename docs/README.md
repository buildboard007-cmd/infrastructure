## üîß Development Workflows

### Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Deploy to Dev
npx cdk deploy "Infrastructure/Dev/Infrastructure-AppStage" --profile dev
```

### Database Queries
Use MCP natural language:
```
"Show me all user assignments for user 19"
"What projects are at location 6?"
"List all active RFIs in project 29"
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Get authentication token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "https://cognito-idp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/" \
  -H "X-Amz-Target: AWSCognitoIdentityProviderService.InitiateAuth" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1" \
  -d '{
    "AuthFlow":"USER_PASSWORD_AUTH",
    "ClientId":"3f0fb5mpivctnvj85tucusf88e",
    "AuthParameters":{
      "USERNAME":"buildboard007+555@gmail.com",
      "PASSWORD":"Mayur@1234"
    }
  }' | jq -r '.AuthenticationResult.IdToken')

# Use token for API calls
curl -X GET "https://74zc1md7sc.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/main/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Deprecated Tables (DO NOT USE)
These tables were dropped in October 2025:
- ‚ùå `iam.org_user_roles`
- ‚ùå `iam.location_user_roles`
- ‚ùå `iam.user_location_access`
- ‚ùå `project.project_user_roles`
- ‚ùå `project.project_managers`

**Use instead:** `iam.user_assignments` with appropriate `context_type`

### Access Control Hierarchy
```
Super Admin (is_super_admin = TRUE)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Sees EVERYTHING

Organization Assignment (context_type = 'organization')
    ‚îî‚îÄ Sees ALL locations & projects

Location Assignment (context_type = 'location')
    ‚îî‚îÄ Sees ALL projects at assigned locations

Project Assignment (context_type = 'project')
    ‚îî‚îÄ Sees ONLY assigned projects
```
