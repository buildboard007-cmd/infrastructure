## üìã Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Archive Outdated Planning Documents

Move to `/docs/archive/`:
```bash
mv DATABASE-ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS.md archive/
mv EXISTING-IAM-ARCHITECTURE-AND-PROJECT-ACCESS-PLAN.md archive/
mv PROJECT-ACCESS-IMPLEMENTATION-FINAL.md archive/
mv project-access-control-design.md archive/
mv issue-management-missing-features.md archive/
mv issue-attachment-validation-gaps.md archive/
```

### Phase 2: Update README.md

Replace current README.md content to make it the main entry point:
- Point to DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md as primary index
- Point to APPLICATION-ARCHITECTURE.md as comprehensive guide
- Keep brief and focus on navigation

### Phase 3: Review and Decide

**Super Admin Documentation:**
- [ ] Review super-admin-workflow.md content
- [ ] Check if already covered in APPLICATION-ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Decide: Keep separate or consolidate

**API Documentation:**
- [ ] Review api-super-admin-restrictions.md
- [ ] Check if covered in APPLICATION-ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Decide: Keep separate reference or consolidate

**Architecture Documentation:**
- [ ] Review multi-api-architecture.md
- [ ] Compare with APPLICATION-ARCHITECTURE.md Lambda section
- [ ] Decide: Archive or keep if it has unique value

**Postman Documentation:**
- [ ] Review postman-collection-migration.md
- [ ] Check if still needed for collection maintenance
- [ ] Decide: Keep or archive

### Phase 4: Create Archive README

Create `/docs/archive/README.md`:
- List archived documents
- Explain why archived
- Note: Reference only for historical context
